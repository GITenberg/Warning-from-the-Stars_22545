<h1>WARNING<br />
FROM THE STARS</h1>

<h2>By RON COCKING</h2>

<p class="illo">ILLUSTRATOR SUMMERS</p>


<p class="cap">IT WAS a beautifully machined
container, shaped like a two
pound chocolate candy box, the
color and texture of lead. The
cover fitted so accurately that it
was difficult to see where it met
the lip on the base.</p>

<p>Yet when Forster lifted the
container from the desk in the
security guards' office, he almost
hit himself in the face with it,
so light was it.</p>

<p>He read the words clumsily
etched by hand into the top
surface with some sharp instrument:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
TO BE OPENED ONLY BY:<br />
Dr. Richard Forster,<br />
Assistant Director,<br />
Air Force Special Research Center,<br />
Petersport, Md.<br />
<br />
CAUTION: Open not later than<br />
24 hours after receipt.<br />
<br />
DO NOT OPEN in atmosphere less<br />
than equivalent of 65,000 feet<br />
above M.S.L.<br />
</p></div>

<p>He turned the container over
and over. It bore no other markings&mdash;no
express label or stamps,
no file or reference number, no
return address.</p>

<p>It was superbly machined, he
saw.</p>

<p>Tentatively he pulled at the
container cover, it was as firm as
if it had been welded on. But
then, if the cover had been closed
in the thin atmosphere of 65,000
feet, it would be held on by the
terrific pressure of a column of
air twelve miles high.</p>

<p>Forster looked up at the burly
guard.</p>

<p>"Who left this here?"</p>

<p>"Your guess is as good as
mine, sir." The man's voice was
as close to insolence as the difference
in status would allow, and
Forster bristled.</p>

<p>"I just clocked in an hour ago.
There was a thick fog came on
all of a sudden, and there was a
bit of confusion when we were
changing over. They didn't say
anything about the box when I
relieved."</p>

<p>"Fog?" Forster queried. "How
could fog form on a warm morning
like this?"</p>

<p>"You're the scientist, sir. You
tell me. Went as fast as it came."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it looks like very
sloppy security. The contents of
this thing must almost certainly
be classified. Give me the book
and I'll sign for it. I'll phone you
the file number when I find the
covering instructions."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Forster was a nervous, over-conscientious
little man, and his
day was already ruined, because
any departure from strict administrative
routine worried and
upset him. Only in his field of
aviation medicine did he feel
competent, secure.</p>

<p>He knew that around the
center they contemptuously called
him "Lilliput." The younger researchers
were constantly trying
to think up new ways to play
jokes on him, and annoy him.</p>

<p>Crawley Preston, the research
center's director and his chief,
had been summoned to Washington
the night before. Forster
wished fervently that he was
around to deal with this matter.
Now that relations between East
and West had reached the snapping
point, the slightest deviation
from security regulations usually
meant a full-scale inquiry.</p>

<p>He signed for the container,
and carried it out to the car, still
seething impotently over the
guard's insolence.</p>

<p>He placed it beside him on the
front seat of his car and drove
up to the building which housed
part of the labs and also his office.</p>

<p>He climbed out, then as he
slammed the door he happened to
glance into the car again.</p>

<p>The seat covers were made of
plastic in a maroon and blue plaid
pattern. But where the box had
rested there was a dirty grey rectangular
patch that hadn't been
there before.</p>

<p>Forster stared, then opened
the door again. He rubbed his
fingers over the discolored spot;
it felt no different than the rest
of the fabric. Then he placed the
box over the area&mdash;it fitted perfectly.</p>

<p>He flopped down on the seat,
his legs dangling out of the car,
fighting down a sudden irrational
wave of panic. He pushed the
container to the other end of the
seat.</p>

<p><i>After all</i>, he rationalized, <i>plastics
are notoriously unstable
under certain conditions. This is
probably a new alloy Washington
wants tested for behavior under
extreme conditions of temperature
and pressure. What's
gotten into you?</i></p>

<p>He took a deep breath, picked
up the box again. Where it had
rested there was another discolored
patch on the car seat
covers.</p>

<p>Holding it away from him,
Forster hurried into the office,
then dumped the box into a metal
wastebasket. Then he went to a
cabinet and pulled out a Geiger
counter, carried it over to the
wastebasket. As he pointed the
probe at the box the familiar
slow clicking reassured him, and
feeling a little foolish he put the
instrument back on its shelf.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;">
<img src="images/001.png" width="390" height="550" alt="" title="" />
In his pressurized chamber, Forster read the startling message.</div>



<p>Hurriedly, he went through
his mail; there was nothing in
it referring to the package. Then
he called the classified filing section;
nobody there knew anything
about it either.</p>

<p>For some reason he couldn't
explain to himself, he wasn't
even surprised.</p>

<p>He stared into the wastebasket.
The clumsily etched instructions
glinted up at him: "<i>To
be opened as soon as possible....</i>"</p>

<p>He picked up the phone and
called the decompression chamber
building.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There was no valid reason why
he should have been self-conscious
as he talked to the lab
attendant in charge of the decompression
tank. He used it a
dozen times a month for tests
and experiments, yet when he
gave his instructions his voice
was labored and strained.</p>

<p>"Some genius in Washington
sent this thing down without any
covering instructions, but it has
to be opened in a hurry in a thin
atmosphere. Er&mdash;I'd like you
to stay on the intercom for a
while in case it blows up in my
face or something." He tried to
laugh, but all that came out was
a croak.</p>

<p>The attendant nodded indifferently,
then helped Forster into
the helmet of his pressure suit.
He climbed up the steps into the
chamber, pulling the airtight
door shut behind him. He placed
the box on the desk in front of
the instrument panel, then turned
back to push the door clamps
into place.</p>

<p>For the first time in the hundreds
of hours he'd spent in the
tank, he knew the meaning of
claustrophobia.</p>

<p>Mechanically, he plugged in
his intercom and air lines, went
through the other routine checks
before ascent, tested communications
with the lab attendant,
then flicked the exhaust motor
switch.</p>

<p>Now there was little to do except
wait. He stared at the box;
in the artificial light it seemed
full of hidden menace, a knowing
aliveness of its own....</p>

<p>Forster shrugged his shoulders
impatiently, as though to throw
off the vague blanket of uneasiness
that was settling around
him. So somebody had forgotten
to send a covering message with
the container, or else it had been
mislaid&mdash;that could happen, although
with security routine as
strict as it was, the possibility
was remote. All the same, it
could happen. After all, what
other explanation was there?
What was it he was afraid of?
There was something about it&mdash;</p>

<p>He glanced at the altimeter.
The needle showed only 10,000
feet, and seemed to be crawling
around the dial. He resolved not
to look at it for three minutes
by the clock on the panel.</p>

<p>When he checked the altimeter
again, it registered just over
30,000 feet. Not even half way
yet.</p>

<p>As the pressure in the tank decreased,
he began to be conscious
of the need for "reverse breathing"&mdash;and
he concentrated on
using his tongue to check the
flow of air into his lungs, then
using the thoracic muscles to exhale
against the higher pressure
inside the suit.</p>

<p>Time seemed to be passing in
micro-seconds ... 25,000 feet ...
30,000 ... 40,000 ... 50,000.</p>

<p>At 62,500 feet he gently tested
the cover of the container again;
it lifted.</p>

<p>As the altimeter needle
flickered on the 65,000-foot mark,
he cut the exhaust motor and
picked up the box. The cover
slipped off easily.</p>

<p>His feeling of anticlimax was
almost ludicrous. As he looked
in, all the box contained was a
flattened roll of some greyish
material.</p>

<p>He took it out; despite its comparative
bulk, it was feather-light.
It had the appearance of
metal, but was as porous and
pliable as a good grade of bond
paper. He could not feel its texture
through his heavy gloves.
He took a good look.</p>

<p>It was new all right&mdash;no doubt
Washington wanted some tests
run on it, although without
covering instructions and data
this trip was wasted. But some
heads would roll when he reported
back on the way the container
had been shipped in.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He started to unroll the material
to get a better look at it,
then he saw that it was covered
with cramped, closely spaced
handwriting in a purplish ink&mdash;handwriting
that was elusively
familiar.</p>

<p>Then he read the words written
in neat capitals at the top, the
name of the man with the familiar
handwriting, and fear came
back, clamped cold fingers around
his throat:</p>

<p><i>James Rawdon Bentley</i></p>

<p>Dear Dick, the writing went
on, Take a large economy-size
grip on yourself. I know this is
going to sound like a voice from
the dead, but I'm very much
alive and kicking&mdash;in the best of
health in fact....</p>

<p>The writing blurred, and instinctively
Forster put his fist
up to rub his eyes, only to meet
the hard plastic of his helmet
visor. James Rawdon Bentley....</p>

<p>It was January 18, 1951, three
years ago, and the jagged line
of the Australian coast stretched
like a small-scale map to the
black curve of the horizon.</p>

<p>From the converted bomber
that was his flying lab, Forster
could see the other American observation
plane cruising on a
parallel course, about half a
mile away, and beyond it downwind
the fringe of the billowing
cloud dome of the super-secret
British thermonuclear shot.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Bentley's voice
from the other plane was crackling
over the earphones, sharp
and urgent:</p>

<p>"Our Geigers and scintillometers
are going crazy! We're getting
out of here! There's
something coming inside ... a
light...."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Silence. Forster had watched
in helpless horror as the other
ship dipped a silver wing, then
nosed down ever so slowly, it
seemed ... down ... down ... in
a dive that seemed to take
hours as Forster's plane tracked
it, ending in a tiny splash like
a pebble being thrown into a
pond; then the grimly beautiful
iridescence of oil and gasoline
spreading across the glassy
waters of the Timor Sea.</p>

<p>No parachutes had opened on
the long journey down. An Australian
air sea rescue launch and
helicopter were at the scene of
the crash in minutes, but neither
bodies nor survivors had been
found, then or later....</p>

<p>"Everything okay, Doctor
Forster?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said hoarsely. "Yes ... everything's okay ... just
routine."</p>

<p>Forster focussed his eyes on
the writing again. There was no
doubt at all that it was Bentley's.
They had roomed and
studied together for four years
at MIT, and then there had been
a couple of years' post-graduate
work after that. During all that
time they had used each other's
notes constantly.</p>

<p>But Bentley was dead.</p>

<p>Forster read on, stunned:</p>

<p>First, you'll want to know
what happened over the Timor
Sea after the shot. Put very
simply, I, the rest of the technicians,
and the crew of the B-29
were transhipped to another vehicle&mdash;without
any damage to
ourselves. How, I'm not allowed
to explain at this stage. Actually,
they only wanted me, but it
wasn't feasible to collect me and
leave the rest behind, so they're
all here, safe and well.</p>

<p>Who are "they," and where
am I? The second question I
can't answer&mdash;not allowed to.
"They," roughly translated, are
"The Shining Ones," which
doesn't tell you anything, of
course. Briefly, they're a couple
of light-years ahead of Earth in
evolution&mdash;mentally, morally,
and physically, although I use
the last word loosely. Too bad
that English is a commercial
language, it's so hard to discuss
really abstract ideas.</p>

<p>Why am I here? The whole
reason for this message is wrapped
up in the answer to that.</p>

<p>As you probably know, Project
Longfall, which I was heading
up was delayed about a year
due to my removal. That was the
sole purpose, although I and the
rest of us are getting special instruction
to keep us occupied.</p>

<p>About the same time, they
also took several other key people
from Britain, Russia, and
the United States. Others were
already here.</p>

<p>The idea then was <i>delay</i>&mdash;to
delay more test shots of
atomic weapons, in the hope that
East and West would come to
some agreement. Now, because
of the growing volume of tests,
and the critical tension which
prevails, delay will no longer
suffice, and far more drastic
steps are to be taken.</p>

<p>I wish you could be here for
only a few minutes to see what
happens after a multi-megaton
thermonuclear test shot is set off
on Earth.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I can't describe it in terms
which would have any relation
to your present knowledge of
physics. All I can say is that life
here is intimately bound up with
the higher laws of electro-magnetism
which at present are only
being guessed at on your level.
It's not the radioactivity which
you know as such which causes
the trouble&mdash;there are neutralizing
devices throughout the
planetary system to take care of
that. The damage is caused by
an ultra-ultra-short wave radiation
which not even the most
sensitive scintillometer you
have can pick up, a very subtle
by-product of every chain reaction.</p>

<p>It doesn't have too much immediate
effect on the lower
forms of life&mdash;including human
beings, if you'll pardon the expression.
But here, it causes a
ghastly carnage, so ghastly it
sickens me even to think about
it for a second.</p>

<p>The incredible thing is that
the people here could stop Earth
from firing another shot if they
wished to, and at 24 hours' notice,
but their philosophy is totally
opposed to force, even
when it means their own destruction.
That will give you an
idea of the kind of people they
are.</p>

<p>(Here they say that Einstein
was on the fringe of discovering
the theory involved when he
died, but was having trouble
with the mathematics. Remember
how Einstein always complained
that he was really a poor
mathematician?)</p>

<p>But with atomic warfare
threatening to break out on
Earth at any minute, they have
got to do something.</p>

<p>This is what they plan to do&mdash;this
is what they <i>are going to
do</i>.</p>

<p>Starting within a few hours
after you receive this message,
a mass removal of key scientists
will begin. They will take 20, 30,
or 40&mdash;roughly equal numbers
from both sides&mdash;every few
hours as technical conditions
allow. That will go on until East
and West agree to drop this
whole mad weapons race. It will
be done quietly, peacefully. Nobody
will be hurt except by a
fluke. But if needs be, they will
lift every major scientific brain
off the face of Earth to stop the
present drift to disaster for
everybody. There are no weapons,
no devices that you have at
present, which can stop this plan
going into effect. There it is&mdash;it's
as simple as that.</p>

<p>If you knew what you were
really headed for, it would need
no steps from here to make both
sides on Earth stop this horrible
foolishness in a moment.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The lesson of Mars is part of
the orientation course here.
(I'm <i>not</i> on Mars). I'm using
up space, so I'll go into note
form for a bit. Martians had an
atomic war&mdash;forgot they had to
breathe ... destroyed 60 per
cent of their atmosphere ...
canals on Mars aren't ... they're
closely-spaced line of shafts
leading to underground cities ... view from Earth telescopes,
shaft mouths appear as dots
which run together into lines
due to eye-fatigue ... British
Royal Astronomical Society figured
that out 30 years ago at
least ... see papers on their
proceedings ... photographs
here show monsters created by
wholesale mutations ... lasted
about four generations before
reproduction failed ... now only
vegetation on Mars ... saw pictures
of last survivors ... horrible ... I was ill for days
after ... imagine having to take 40
separate breaths after making a
single step!</p>

<p>Getting back to the others
here ... a regular U. N. Remember
O'Connor and Walters
in our class? They're here.
Check, you'll find that O'Connor
is "detached" from Oak Ridge
and Walters from Aiken for
"special duty." That's Central
Intelligence's story for their disappearance.</p>

<p>Remember those top German
boys the Russians were supposed
to have gotten to before the Allies
could reach them after the
Nazi collapse? <i>They're here too!</i>
And Kamalnikov, and Pretchkin
of the Russian Academy.</p>

<p>Believe me (the style and the
writing was a little less urgent
again now), I've had all the intellectual
stuffing knocked out of
me here.</p>

<p>We all have had, for that matter.
We're supposed to be the
cream of the crop, but imagine
sitting down to instruction from
people whose I.Q.s start where
yours leaves off!</p>

<p>But what has really made
most of us here feel pretty humble
is the way they have demolished
Earth's so-called "scientific
method"&mdash;and used the method
itself to prove that it doesn't
stand up!</p>

<p>You know how we've always
been taught to observe, collect
data, then erect a theory to fit
the data, a theory which has to
be modified when other data
came along which don't fit into
it.</p>

<p>Here they work the opposite
way&mdash;they say: "Know the fundamental
principles governing
the operation of the universe
and then all the pieces fit together
inside this final Truth."</p>

<p>I understand now why so
many of the Oak Ridge boys
turned to religion after they
had been exposed to the electron
microscope for a while&mdash;they
realized they had gone as far as
their "scientific" training would
ever take them.</p>

<p>Time and space are running
out. I know all this must sound
confused and incredible, Dick;
I'm still confused myself. But I
want you to think about what
I've written, then take the action
you think best. I know it
won't be easy for you.</p>

<p>If you think this is some
maniac's idea of a joke, you'll
have proof very soon that it
isn't, because <i>one of the people
at your Center is due to leave
for here any time now</i>.</p>

<p>You're wondering why I used
this weird and wonderful means
of communication. The problem
was to find a writing material
which would stand up in Earth's
atmosphere&mdash;oddly enough, it's
not the oxygen which causes the
trouble, but the so-called "inert"
nitrogen. The container will
probably not disintegrate for a
couple of days at sea level atmospheric
pressure, but this
material I'm writing on would
not last more than a few seconds.
That's one reason they picked
you&mdash;most people just don't
have a spare decompression
chamber up in the attic! The
other reason was that with your
photographic memory, you'll
know this is my handwriting, beyond
the shadow of a doubt, I
hope.</p>

<p>I'm sure you've sat in that
pressure suit long enough. But
remember, if you want to take
another look at this, you'll have
to put it back in the container
before you go "down."</p>

<p class="signing">Wishing you all you would
wish for yourself,<br />
Jim.</p>

<p>Forster examined the signature.
That was the way Bentley
made the capital J&mdash;it looked almost
like a T, with just a faint
hook on the bottom of the down-stroke.
Then the way it joined
the&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hey, Doc&mdash;are you going to
tie up the tank all day? I've got
work to do."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Forster recognized the voice
on the intercom as Tom Summerford's.
Summerford was one
of the crop of recent graduates
to join the Center&mdash;brash, noisy,
irresponsible like the rest of
them. He knew Forster hated
being called "Doc," so he never
lost an opportunity to use the
word. True, he was gifted and
well-trained, but he was a ringleader
in playing the practical
jokes on Forster which might
have been funny in college, but
which only wasted a research
team's time in these critical
days.</p>

<p>Practical joke.</p>

<p>Anger flooded over him.</p>

<p>Yes, this was all a macabre
game cooked up by Summerford,
with the help of some of his
pals. Probably they were all out
there now, snickering among
themselves, waiting to see his
face when he came out of the
decompression chamber ... waiting
to gloat....</p>

<p>"Hey Doc! You still with us?"</p>

<p>"I'll be out very shortly,"
Forster said grimly. "Just wait
right there."</p>

<p>He spun the air inlet controls;
impatiently, he watched as the
altimeter needle began its anti-clockwise
movement.</p>

<p>He'd call a staff meeting
right away, find the culprits and
suspend them from duty. Preston
would have to back him up.
If Summerford proved to be the
ringleader, he would insist on his
dismissal, Forster decided. And
he would see to it that the young
punk had trouble getting another
post.</p>

<p>The fantastic waste of time
involved in such an elaborate
forgery ... Forster trembled
with indignation. And using the
name of a dead man, above all a
scientist who had died in the interests
of research, leaving behind
him a mystery which still
troubled the Atomic Energy
Commission, because nobody had
ever been able to explain that
sudden dive in a plane which
was apparently functioning perfectly,
and flown by a veteran
crew....</p>

<p>He glanced down at the roll.</p>

<p>Was it his imagination, or
had the purplish ink begun to
fade? He ran a length of it
through his fingers, and then he
saw that in places there were
gaps where the writing had disappeared
altogether. He glanced
up at the altimeter needle,
which was sliding by the 24,000-foot
mark.</p>

<p>He looked back at his hands
again, just in time to see the roll
part in two places, leaving only
the narrow strip he held between
his gloved fingers.</p>

<p>He put the strip on the desk,
and bent clumsily in his suit to
retrieve the other pieces from
the floor. But wherever he grabbed
it, it fell apart. Now it
seemed to be melting before his
eyes. In a few seconds there was
nothing.</p>

<p>He straightened up. The strip
he had left on the desk had disappeared,
too. No ash, no residue.
Nothing.</p>

<p>His thought processes seemed
to freeze. He glanced mechanically
at the altimeter. It read
2,500 feet.</p>

<p>He grabbed at the two pieces
of the container. They still felt
as rigid as ever. He fitted them
together carefully, gaining a
crumb of security from the act.</p>

<p>He realized vaguely that the
altimeter needle was resting on
zero, but he had no idea how
long he had been sitting there,
trying to find a thread of logic
in the confused welter of
thoughts, when he heard the
scrape of metal on metal as
somebody wrestled with the door
clamps from the outside.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He was certain of only one
thing. His memory told him that
the signature that was no longer
a signature had been written by
Jim Rawdon, who couldn't possibly
have survived that crash
into the Timor Sea....</p>

<p>From behind, somebody was
fumbling with his helmet connections,
then fresh air and
familiar sounds rushed in on
him as the helmet was taken
away.</p>

<p>Summerford's thin, intelligent
face was opposite his.</p>

<p>"Doc! Are you all right?" he
was asking sharply. For once,
there was no superciliousness in
his voice.</p>

<p>"I'm fine," Forster said heavily.
"I&mdash;I've got a headache.
Stayed in here too long, I suppose."</p>

<p>"What's in the box?" Summerford
asked.</p>

<p>The way he asked told Forster
at once that the youngster knew
nothing about it.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;just some half-baked
idea out of the Pentagon. Some
colonel trying to justify his existence."
He clutched the box to
him as though Summerford
might try to take it away. "The
tank's all yours."</p>

<p>He turned and clambered out
of the chamber. He put the box
down on the concrete floor, and
climbed out of the pressure suit,
watching the box all the time. It
seemed to gleam up at him, as
though it had eyes, full of silent
menace.</p>

<p>He realized vaguely that Summerford
was standing in front
of him again, looking anxious.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure you're
okay?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine," Forster said, hardly
recognizing his own voice.</p>

<p>He picked up the box and
stumbled out, heading for his
office.</p>

<p>When he walked in, his secretary
was answering the line fitted
with a scrambler, which
connected directly with the
Pentagon.</p>

<p>"General Morganson," she
said, handing him the receiver.</p>

<p>Forster took the receiver, sat
down at his desk and took a deep
breath, fighting hard to regain
his self control.</p>

<p>"Forster," he said into the
mouthpiece when the office door
closed behind the girl.</p>

<p>"Forster! What the dickens
has happened to Preston? My
driver met the train here this
morning, but there was no sign
of him. But the Pullman porter
checked him in last night, and
we found all his gear and papers
in his compartment!"</p>

<p>"He left here in plenty of time
to catch the train, General,"
Forster heard himself say. "He
took the train to get a night's
rest." He realized how irrelevant
the last statement was only after
he had made it.</p>

<p>The General was talking again ... important meeting with the
Joint Chiefs ... whole briefing
team was being held up ... he'd
reported it to the C.I.A. as a precautionary
measure....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Forster could see the words
on the roll, the roll that wasn't,
as though they were engraved on
his eye-retinas: <i>As a beginning,
and to prove this isn't just a bit
of hocus-pocus, one of the people
at your Center is due to leave
for here any time now.</i></p>

<p>"General," Forster broke in
hoarsely. "I've got some very
important information which
you must have. I'll leave by
heliplane right away."</p>

<p>He replaced the phone receiver
in its cradle, wondering how
convincing he would be able to
make his story. At least, even if
he didn't have Bentley's letter,
he had the container. That
should help.</p>

<p>But when he looked across the
desk, he saw that it too had disappeared,
without a trace.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>General Morganson was the
newest product of the Atomic
Age, half soldier, half scientist&mdash;shrewd
and perceptive, an intellectual
giant.</p>

<p>He listened carefully, without
comment or change of expression,
as Forster doggedly went
through his story in chronological
order.</p>

<p>Half way through, he held up
his hand and started pushing
buttons on the console built into
his desk. Within a few moments
men began filing into the room,
and sat down around Forster.</p>

<p>Then the general motioned to
the clerk seated in the corner by
a tape recorder.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, listen to this
playback and then I'll have Dr.
Forster here go on from there."</p>

<p>What was left of Forster's
confidence leaked away as he
heard his own diffident voice
filling the room again. It was
like being awake in the middle
of a weird dream.</p>

<p>But when the tape recorder
hissed into silence, he went on,
staring straight ahead of him in
quiet desperation.</p>

<p>When he ended his story,
there was silence for a moment.
Everyone sat motionless.</p>

<p>Then Morganson looked up
and around.</p>

<p>"Well gentlemen? Mr. Bates,
C.I.A. first."</p>

<p>This was no longer a story
told by one man; it had become
a problem, a situation to be
evaluated objectively.</p>

<p>"Well, sir ... the only part of
the thing I can comment on at
this point is the stuff about
O'Connor and Walters. That
checks. They both disappeared
without a trace. It was treated
as a maximum security situation,
and we did give out the
story they had been assigned to
special duty." He glanced briefly
at Forster. "Up until now, we
assumed that only the directors
at Aiken and Oak Ridge knew
the real situation&mdash;outside of
the Atomic Energy Commission
and C.I.A., of course. This represents
a very serious leak&mdash;or...."
His voice trailed away.</p>

<p>"Colonel Barfield, Intelligence?"</p>

<p>The young colonel tried to
sound flippant, unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>"General, acting on the assumption
the story is true, it
would answer about two hundred
question marks in our files.
Maybe more, with further
study."</p>

<p>The C.I.A. man cleared his
throat and raised a finger.</p>

<p>"For everybody's information,"
he said, "a preliminary
field check shows that Dr. Preston's
train was stopped for ten
minutes by fog last night. The
train's radar installation failed
simultaneously. There wouldn't
be anything odd about that except
the temperature at the time
was about 65 degrees, and the
humidity was only 55 per cent.
Consider that, gentlemen.</p>

<p>"Theoretically, fog can't form
under such conditions. Similar
local fog occurred on the occasions
when O'Connor and Walters
were reported missing. The
Met. people couldn't explain that,
either. That's all."</p>

<p>Morganson sat up straight, as
though he had suddenly made a
decision.</p>

<p>"I don't think there's any
value in further discussion at
this point. You will all have
transcripts of Dr. Forster's
statement within a few minutes.
According to that statement, we
are due to lose a number of key
men in the next few hours. I'll
have Code One emergency precautions
instituted at all research
establishments, and I
think the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs should hear from me
right away. Colonel Barfield, I'd
like you to ask Colonel Malinowski,
the Russian military attach&eacute;
to see me here not later than an
hour from now. We'll have a full
dress conference here at 8
o'clock tomorrow morning, with
written evaluation reports in detail
from all branches. Dr. Forster,
consider yourself assigned
to Pentagon duty as of now, and
until further notice."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Forster sat, dazed, until he
realized that the others had left,
and the general was standing in
front of him.</p>

<p>"Go get some rest, Forster,"
the other man said with surprising
gentleness. "You've had a
tough day."</p>

<p>As Forster slept that early
summer night, weathermen
across the world were marking
their weather maps with thousands
of observations&mdash;feathery
wind arrows, temperatures,
barometric pressures and relative
humidities.</p>

<p>Then, as they drew their isobars,
the pattern for the northern
hemisphere emerged. A
giant high pressure system with
its center in northern Oklahoma
promised warm fair weather
across America. Another, centered
east of the Ural Mountains,
forecast clear weather for
most of Europe and northern
Asia.</p>

<p>A low pressure trough between
was dropping light warm
rain on the green fields of England,
but from Seattle to Washington,
D. C, from Stettin to
Vladivostock the sun was rising
or setting in clear skies.</p>

<p>Then about 9 P.M. Eastern
Standard Time, a thickening
mist descended over warm and
drowsy southwest South Carolina.
It was a fog that was not a
fog, observers said afterwards,
because there was no damp, no
coldness&mdash;just a steady loss of
visibility until a man couldn't
see his hand held up in front of
his face, even though a bright
moon was shining. Most of the
reporting night shift at the
Aiken hydrogen bomb plant
never reached the tightly-guarded
gates. Those who did were
not allowed in.</p>

<p>At the same hour, across the
world at the newly-built underground
heavy water factory of
Rossilovskigorsk, west of the
southern tip of Lake Baikal, the
late morning sun cast deep shadows
into the gaping holes in the
hillside which marked the plant
entrances and exits. Deep below,
miles of filtration chambers
hissed quietly as they prepared
their deadly concentrate.</p>

<p>Then, without warning, the
sun grew watery and paled, and
within a few minutes a haze began
to form at ground level. It
grew thicker and thicker; the
sun became a dim orange sphere,
then was blotted out. Total darkness
enveloped the area.</p>

<p>And at the same hour, the
watchers manning the lonely
circle of probing radar domes,
facing each other across the
frozen wastes of the Arctic,
cursed softly in Russian and
English as their scopes sweeping
the upper air first went
blank and then dark.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They were shaken men at the
meeting in General Morganson's
office the next morning.</p>

<p>"Over 30 key men gone from
Aiken," Morganson was saying.
"In terms of goals, it means that
our 1960 program now cannot
possibly be fulfilled until 1965.
If the situation develops as forecast
in Dr. Forster's statement,
our entire nuclear weapons program
will grind to a halt within
two weeks. If we drain men from
civilian research, it will cause a
total breakdown in the civilian
atomic power production program.
As you all know, the nation's
entire economic expansion
program is based on the availability
of that power. Without
it, industry will be forced into
a deep freeze. That in turn
means we might as well run up
a white flag on the White House
lawn."</p>

<p>He smiled thinly. "I would be
a lot more worried than I am except
we have the first indications
that the other side is in the same
boat. I broke every regulation in
the book last night when I talked
to Malinowski. I took the
liberty of warning him, on the
basis that there was nothing to
lose. His reaction then was that
it was all a Wall Street-capitalist
plot&mdash;'psychological warfare,' he
called it.</p>

<p>"He phoned me an hour ago.
Sounded as though he'd just seen
a ghost. He said the Russian ambassador
had asked for an appointment
with the Secretary of
State this morning...."</p>

<p>Forster, bewildered and out
of his depth in these global
problems, let the flood of words
pour over him.</p>

<p>Then he realized that Morganson
was staring at him over the
telephone receiver at his ear,
and that the room was very
quiet.</p>

<p>Then Morganson said respectfully:
"Very well, Mr. President.
We'll have Doctor Forster
there."</p>

<p>Forster was relegated to the
sidelines after his interview with
the grave-faced man in the
White House. Events were moving
swiftly&mdash;events which Forster
could read behind the
blurred black headlines of the
newspapers.</p>

<p>The Russian ambassador was
closeted with the Secretary of
State for a record six-hour talk.
Then the Soviet Foreign Minister
took off for Washington at
30 minutes' notice, and another
record was made when he spent
all day with the President. The
Washington columnists began to
hint of lessening tension in the
cold war, and the wire services
carried reports of Russian radio
broadcasts talking of a new era
of cooperation between East and
West.</p>

<p>Only fragments of the broadcasts
could be monitored, because
radio reception had suddenly
deteriorated right across
the world. The reports could not
be confirmed because Russia had
cut all phone communication
with the outside world. There
was no possible mode of contact.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Meanwhile, in the United
States, television reception was
blacking out for hours at a time,
with no explanation available.
The Civil Aeronautics Administration
and the Air Force
banned all plane movements under
instrument flight conditions,
because radar navigational
equipment had become so unreliable
as to be useless.</p>

<p>Newspapers across the nation
were reporting sudden fogs of
short duration which baffled local
weathermen. The U. S.
Weather Bureau in Washington
refused to comment.</p>

<p>For the first time in the history
of an East-West conference,
there was no haggling, no propaganda
speeches. Hour after hour,
even as the talks went on, the
cream of the world's scientific
brains quietly continued to disappear,
it was revealed later.</p>

<p>In three days, the major powers
accomplished what they had
failed to do in the previous 15
years. Just 4 days and 21 hours
after Forster had first talked to
General Morganson at the Pentagon,
a treaty was signed ending
the world atomic weapons race.</p>

<p>And it had all happened, was
over and done, before the people
of the globe could realize what
was happening, before they
could rise in mass panic in the
face of the incredible unknown.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the
announcement, radio and radar
communications suddenly returned
to normal, and reports of
the mysterious fogs ceased.</p>

<p>Back at the Center, as he
walked down the floodlit ramp
of the heliport towards his car,
Forster found himself thinking
of the experimental work on the
dream state which he had performed
as a graduate student.
He knew that a dream which
might take half an hour to recount
took only a fraction of a
second to occur in the sub-conscious
of the sleeper as he
awoke.</p>

<p>It was the same way with the
events of the last five days; already
details were becoming
fuzzy and blurred as though they
had happened five years ago.</p>

<p>He opened the car door, and
the soft glow of the dome light
filled the interior.</p>

<p>Then he saw again the neat
rectangular discoloration on the
seat covers, and the jolt back to
reality was almost a physical
thing. Relief, overwhelming,
flooded over him.</p>

<p>He looked up into the indigo-velvet
sky. Above him was the
enormous triangle formed by
Deneb, Vega, and Altair. Framed
within it were a thousand
other dimmer stars, but all, he
knew, far, far bigger than the
speck of solidified gases called
Earth.</p>

<p>Somewhere out there, living,
thinking, breathing was Bentley.</p>

<p>"Good night," Forster said
out loud.</p>

<p>And somehow, he was sure he
wasn't talking into thin air.</p>


<p class="theend">THE END</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
